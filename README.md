# asteroid_game
A nostalgic game that aims to eliminate the threats of the asteroids that try to hit the spaceship.
The game was developed as part of a Python course.
It is built in the form of object-oriented programming with 4 classes:
Ship - which represents the ship, its life and describes its movement.
Asteroids - describes the movement of asteroids, their speed, and their lifetime.
Torpedo - the tool with which the asteroids are blown up.
Screen - the board on which the objects live and move.
The Screen class was developed by the course team and I introduced some changes to make the game more enjoyable.
for example: a stop button whose purpose is to stop the spaceship when it flies too fast.
A reverse flight button that slows down the spaceship and even allows it to fly backwards.
I also changed the colors of the screen, the asteroids and the spacecraft.
All you have to do to enjoy the game is to download the 5 files to a folder and run the asteroid_main file.
Enjoy!
